This repository holds code for for manuscript titled "Social isolation and mental health: a behavioural genetic analysis from childhood to young adulthood". Analyses include Cholesky decomposition twin model of social isolation from ages 5, 7, 10, and 12, independent pathway model showing the overlap between social isolation and mental health problems from ages 12 to 18, and discordant twin multi-level modelling to assess environmental factors involved in the association between social isolation and mental health problems. All data from the E-Risk Study. 

For greater clarity when reviewing the code and results for this manuscript, this repository has been converted into an R pages website. **The website can be accessed here: ** 

Analyses for this project were conducted in R (Version 4.0.3). Below names and locations for all  scripts are listed, with a brief explanation of what each script entails, for more detail please go to the [website]().
